# PA Lottery Front End Code Challenge

Thanks for your interest in joining our team!

For this exercise, we'd like you to refactor this bit of code. Do as much or as little as you feel is necessary to clean up and modernize this example. Please keep in mind that this role will require you to maintain legacy code like this on a regular basis. We do encourage you to take a more modern approach to this challenge, but be aware that a working knowledge of these older technologies will be a necessary to succeed on this team.

The code included in this repository is an excerpt from the [Pick 2](https://www.palottery.state.pa.us/Draw-Games/PICK-2.aspx) page on our website. In addition to refactoring the HTML and CSS, we'd like you to write some JavaScript to restore the tab functionality found on our production site. You may use jQuery or vanilla JS.
